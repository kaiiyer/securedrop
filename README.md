SecureDrop is an open-source whistleblower submission system that media organizations can use to securely accept documents from, and communicate with anonymous sources. It was originally created by the late Aaron Swartz and is currently managed by the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press).

## Documentation

SecureDrop's documentation is built and hosted by [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) at https://docs.securedrop.org.

There are two versions of the [SecureDrop documentation](https://docs.securedrop.org): **stable** and **latest**. The **stable** documentation is the default, and corresponds to the latest stable release of SecureDrop. It is the best version of the documentation for end users (Sources, Journalists, or Administrators). The **latest** documentation is automatically built from the most recent commit to the SecureDrop development branch. It is most useful for developers and contributors to the project. You can switch between versions of the documentation by using the toolbar in the bottom left corner of the Read the Docs screen.
