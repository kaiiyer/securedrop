Upgrade from 0.14.0 to 1.0.0
============================

Updating the Tails Workstations
-------------------------------
We recommend that you update all Tails drives to version 3.16, which was
`released <https://tails.boum.org/news/version_3.16/index.en.html>`_
on September 4, 2019. Follow the Tails graphical prompts on your workstations to
perform this upgrade.

On a subsequent boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

.. note::

   If you have not previously updated this workstation to SecureDrop 0.14.0, we
   recommend following the :ref:`manual update procedure <Manual Update Procedure>`.
   The manual procedure enforces the use of a secure keyserver.

   If you are unsure which version of SecureDrop a workstation is using, you can
   run the command ``git status`` in  ``~/Persistent/securedrop``. The first
   line of the output will tell you the current version, e.g.,
   "HEAD detached at 0.14.0".

If the workstation is on SecureDrop 0.14.0, it is safe to use the graphical
updater by clicking "Update Now":

Please note that this only updates the SecureDrop code on your Tails
workstations. Tails updates must be performed separately.

.. _Manual Update Procedure:

Manually updating the SecureDrop code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are running an older version of SecureDrop on this workstation, or if the
automated update fails, you can perform a manual update by running the following
commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
  git tag -v 1.0.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the
new release: ::

    git checkout 1.0.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '1.0.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

.. include:: ../includes/always-backup.txt

Enabling v3 Onion Services
--------------------------
SecureDrop 1.0.0 is the first release to support
`v3 onion services <https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/NextGenOnions#IntrotoNextGenOnionServicesakaprop224>`__.
Version 3 of the protocol for onion services offers significant security benefits,
and we recommend that you transition your SecureDrop installation to v3 in the
near future.

Enabling v3 onion services will create new, 56 character .onion addresses for
your *Source Interface*, your *Journalist Interface*, and for SSH access (if
SSH access over Tor is enabled). This means that you will have to update the
.onion address advertised on your SecureDrop landing page after switching to
v3.

For testing purposes, you can enable v3 alongside v2 before switching fully to
v3. Please see our :doc:`documentation for v3 onion services <../v3_services>`
for more information.

Logo Update
-----------
SecureDrop ships with a new default logo for the SecureDrop project. This will
not affect your installation if you have already customized the logo of your
instance. If you have not done so yet, we recommend uploading a custom logo by
following :ref:`the instructions <Updating Logo Image>`.

If you currently show the SecureDrop logo on your landing page or in other
materials related to SecureDrop, please update it to the new version. See our
`brand refresh guide <https://securedrop.org/brand-refresh-guide-2019/>`__ (PDF)
for more information, and please do not hesitate to reach out if we can help
in any way.
