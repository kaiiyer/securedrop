Backing Up the Tails Workstations
---------------------------------
USB flash drives degrade over time and vary in quality. To ensure continued
access to SecureDrop by administrators and journalists, we recommend backing up
the Tails Workstations on the occasion of a new SecureDrop release, after you
have completed the upgrade process for each drive.

You can use a single storage device for backups of multiple workstations. See
our :doc:`Workstation Backup Guide <../backup_workstations>` for more information.
